## ðŸ“š Overview

Regression models are a type of **supervised learning** algorithm used for predicting continuous values. This section covers:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Polynomial Regression**
- **Ridge and Lasso Regression**
- **Multiple Linear Regression**

---

## ðŸ”§ Key Concepts Covered

- **Hypothesis Functions**
- **Cost Function & Gradient Descent**
- **Evaluation Metrics**: MSE, RMSE, MAE
- **Feature Selection & Engineering**
